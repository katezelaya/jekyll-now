title: More into the Graphics...
---

Herkese Merhaba! :)

From my last post, I shared how I was able to do basic graphics for Hopper's Fables! I continue to work on improving the graphics and met 
up with my research mates to share and explain how I did this. From there, each of us was able to make a little more progress in our 
graphics. However, after attempting to further our graphics I found that perhaps using the canvas element was not a good choice. The 
reason for this was because while coding a particular graphic, I wondered as to how the block was going to know to manipulate certain 
graphics. After further research, I came to realize that maybe just creating the graphics without the canvas element would be smarter. 
This because if I use plain HTML, I can assign each graphic component an id. With this id, I can use it in the JavaScript and with the 
blocks. This will be a lot easier to manipulate with, and I spent the week trying to mess with both sides of with and without the canvas 
element. In addition, I made changes to the term commonalities and made them more focused for what our project is about. In additon, I have created a wiki page for our research group containing posters and presentations we have presented, and also what we are doing! This information can be found at our groups github!

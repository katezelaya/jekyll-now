title: Star Wars Perspective Update... 
---
Hello :)

As I mentioned in the last blog, we redesigned the layout of our game, with having the images in a "Star Wars" perspective. I found this 
perspective to be challenging because I had to make everything 3D. This is taking a lot of time, but it is worth it because it is starting 
to all piece together!

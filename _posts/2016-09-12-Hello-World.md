Top of the morning, Everyone :) 

This past week, my group mates and faculty advisor met up to discuss the next steps to our project. We decided that an evaluation rubric for the different block languages out there should be ready by our meeting this week. In this rubric, we will have written down the good and bad characteristics about each of the block languages. Once we have this rurbic set, we will be able to make sure that our own block language will have the good characteristics and improve any of the bad ones as much as possible. In addition, we will be researching this week the impact of incorporating creativity in block langauges. I feel it is very important to include creativity in coding but also feel it can be very distracting. For instance, on Scratch, some might spend their time picking out characters, but on the other hand not allowing them to do so might uninterest them from the lesson. So, this week I will also research the downside of limiting creativity, as well as the benefits of encouraging creativity.

Ol√° a todos :)

This week, as always, was doing as many graphics as possible so I can start helping code the blocks! I mainly was doing backgrounds and 
editing the previous graphics to make sure they look good. I am really pushing to finish early this comming week, because we need them to 
code the other block functionalities. 

Below, I have attached a sneekpeak snapshot of the "Classroom Scene".

This biggest challenge of doing the graphics is making them look 3D because of the perpective we choose to go with. And about each scene 
background takes me around an hour and sometimes more. 

However, I did learn some new layering techniques so I do not have to draw every little thing all at once.

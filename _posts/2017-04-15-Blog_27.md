title: Finishing the graphics & more...
---
 
 Hello, Everyone :)
 
 This week, I was able to create the last character for the game, a koala, and also finished the backgrounds for each of the scenes my 
 group decided on! Because of this, I am now able to join forces with my other research mates to create the code that will determine the 
 functionalities of the graphics. Cindi was successful in putting her latest work and progress of this task onto our github! I spent the 
 week trying to learn how to do this so we can get these blocks going! Not an easy thing to pick up on but I am really glad and thankful 
 one of our teammates got a feel for it so she can help me out! 
 
 Our goal this coming week is to at least get each of the character matched with an already done block functionality. 
 
 I learned this week that, as always, you really dont now if you know something until your start implementing it! Having someone who has 
 been already working on this task is good because she can share her struggles and give us recommendations so we can move forward better.

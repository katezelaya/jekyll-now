Here, I will be sharing the progress of my CREU research project weekly! Very exciting right?!

Right now, my group mates and I have been gathering information about the existing block languages such as Snap, Scratch,
and App Inventor. We also are currently researching educational articles so that we can make an evaluation rubric for block languages.
This will demonstrate both the strengths and weaknesses in the existing block languages especially when trying to teach elementary-aged
students or students with learning disabilities. I am finding helpful articles, but am still trying to decided which of them will be the
most helpful, and when I do I will be sure to share the links here:) 

But to be honest, the hardest part was finding a platform to blog for you all :) I have programmed a little bit with HTML and CSS, but
never learned beyond the basics sadly. And funny enough I wanted to make my blogging website from scratch...but came to a conclusion that
using Jekyll and Github pages would be easier. Though learning to build a website from the ground up is in my near future :)

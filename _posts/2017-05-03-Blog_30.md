title: Finals Report Prep
---

Hello, Everyone :)

This week, our main focus was getting our final report in for the year :) Each of us worked on a section of the final report and then we 
combined our sections together. I was in charge of including the graphics into the report, creating a better version of our project 
website (initially we had everything on github wiki), writing up the process of our entire project, and posting my summaries of the 
articles we reviewed in preparation of creating the rubric. And on the side, we continued to work on our game, which happens to also be 
our goal for this week.

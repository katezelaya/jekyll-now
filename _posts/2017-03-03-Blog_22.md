title: Hopper's Fables Web App is in the midst...:)
---

Hello, Guys :)

This week was very interesting because I got to really test my web developing skills! Basically what I did was really focus in creating 
Hopper's Fables Web Application platform and also creating one more character for our game (so far I have created 2 characters). Creating 
the web app platform was quite tricky because of the problem I have been struggling with the past two weeks! This being, divs, classes, 
wrappers, and also now adding padding, margin, and something about flex box and inner tubes! :O Who knew positioning a certain layout 
would be so challenging but it was very fun :)

title: Our Rubric is coming SO close to its final product!

Cheerio, Everyone :)

This past week my group mates and I have been working on finalizing our rubric for our block language and submitted an abstract. 
We were each given a portion of the "in-progress" rubric and researched on them. 
The four parts of the rubric I got assigned to was: 

* Attractive Text/Graphics/Video Sound, Navigation 
* Deep Shareability - Computer Clubhouses 
* Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
* Creative Options

For each of the parts, we found two articles/journals from academic sites that backed our reseason, as to why 
they are essential in including in our rubric.

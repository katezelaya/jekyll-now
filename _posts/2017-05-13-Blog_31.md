title: Getting things to sync....

Hey, Guys :)

This week I have been experimenting on an obstacle our team has been confronting for a while now, which is getting the graphics to follow 
what the block says to do. I have been researching online tutorials, online forums, and basically everywhere on the internet. The hard 
part for me is understanding how all of this will work. In other words, I know how it is supposed to work but us doing it is tricky. All 
of us are working together on this to get a start in the real development of the game. I just feel that they are going to be a lot of 
"strings attached" because everything depends on everything, is how I am thinking. Nevertheless, you do not really learn anything if you 
are not struggling/challenged. Though an idea that I am working on now to get things to move is giving things ID's so that Javascript 
knows what to control. This might be a no brainer, however what if I want the block to control many things?...

In addition, I am working out the layout of the blocks. By this I mean, our team had agreed to make the blocks fit like a story to help 
students with reading. So with this, that is my goal this week.

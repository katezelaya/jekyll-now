Welcome to my research blog with the CRA-W CREU program! :D

Here, I will be sharing the progress of my CREU research project weekly! Very exciting right?!

Currently, my mates and I are gathering information about the existing block languages such as Snap, Scratch,
and App Inventor. We also are currently researching educational articles so that we can make an evaluation rubric for block languages.
This will demonstrate both the strengths and weaknesses in the existing block languages especially when trying to teach elementary-aged
students or students with learning disabilities. I am finding helpful articles, but am still trying to decide which of them will be the
most helpful, and when I do I will be sure to share my findings here:)

Bonjour Ã  tous :)

Two weeks ago, my group mates and I divided our almost finished rubric. I was not able to find all the inforamtion I wanted so this past week I worked on completing this part of the research. 

Below, I will share part of the rubric I was in charge of, including its 3-point system:

|                    | 1 Point          | 2 Point          | 3 Point          |
|                    | Requirement      | Requirement      | Requirement      |
|--------------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| Attractive         | - Normal Text    | - Good text,     | - Attractive     |
|Text/Graphics/Video |- Hard to read    |   basic          |   text           |

|                    |                  |                  |                  |

| Deep Shareability -| - No way of      | - Allows limited | - allows easy    |
| Computer Clubhouses|   sharing        |   sharing        |   project share  |

Each member of my group did a 3-point system according to the part they were assinged. We have combined them
to make a master rubric, and finalized the rubric as well. We made changes, took some things out, and discussed
it together to make sure we are fully ready to move on to the coding portion of our reasearch.

This coming week and the next, my group mate Cindi and I will begin to start to foundation of our block langauge! :) We will
start to mess around with Blockly's API, which is very exciting :)

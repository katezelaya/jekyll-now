Bonjour Ã  tous :)

Two weeks ago, my group mates and I divided our almost finished rubric. I was not able to find all the inforamtion I wanted so this past week I worked on completing this part of the research. 

Below, I will share part of the rubric I was in charge of, including its 3-point system:

|                     | 1 Point          | 2 Point          | 3 Point          |

|-------------------- |------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Attractive          | - Normal Text
|Text/Graphics/Video  | - Hard to read

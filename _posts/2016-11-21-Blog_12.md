title: Revisiting our Rubric for Edits
---

Hello :)

This past week, we continue to work witht the Blockly Developer Tools and also we recieved feedback on our 
rubric from the College of Education. After they reviewed our rubric, they provided some notes so that we
could adjust our rubric and make it even better. In addition, we made a date as to when our first block should
be done, which is December 2! If you remember from my last post, I am in charge for making the "loop" block,
and right now I am researching if someone has already evaluated terminology appropriateness within demographic.
This is becauase one of criteria from our rubric is appropiate terminology, so when I am building the "loop" block
perhaps there is another name that I could use to better help the student users. 

This coming week, I will continue to do the tasks I have been working on from above and will write in my next
post how I implemented the Developer Tools and my thoughts on using it! In addition, I am making some simple
but cool things with JavaScript using codeschool.com! What is nice is that their form of teaching is very
interactive and changes between teaching styles to keep you interested! :) I find Javascript to be very 
similar to the other languages I know very well, specifically Java :)

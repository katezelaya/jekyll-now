title: Let the Coding Begin! :)
---


Hello Everyone :)

We have finally begun to really start the fun part...CODING :) There were two ways we could have approached coding the functionality of our 
blocks: write this code by hand using the API or using the Blockly Developer Tools. Our group decided it would be easier to use the Blockly 
Developer Tools and are following the instructions in the "Create Custom Blocks" tab to get started! Each of us picked one control block 
and a graphic to code. I choose to code a loop or something of the like, and I also the character moving through the grid lines! So far I 
been messing around with the Developer Tools and getting to know the workspace :) In the coming weeks, I plan to have finished my control block
and graphic, as well as prepare a presentation for next Friday for a conference :)

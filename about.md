## About Me
Hello :)

My name is Kate Zelaya and I am majoring in computer science at Kennesaw State University. I am excited to be a part of the
CRA-W CREU program and to be participating in this research project :)

## My Research

The research I will be doing this year is on "Analyzing the Potential of Learning Reading and Math Skills Through Computational
Thinking". With the help of my group mates: Deja Tyla Jackson, Erica Pantoja, Cindi Simmons, and facutly adivors: Dr. Amber Wagner and
Dr. Melissa Driver, we hope to enhance students with learning disabilites with skills such as math, literacy, and computational thinking
using code :)
